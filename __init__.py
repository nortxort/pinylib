 pinylib (originally called tinylib) provides an easy way to interface with tinychat chat rooms.

 It contains classes/methods and functions to establish a connection
 to tinychat's RTMP server. The idea was to make a library/module that would serve
 as a building block for developers, wanting to make a helper and/or entertainment bot.
